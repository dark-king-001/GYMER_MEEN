        <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

        <h2>Authenticity Guarantee</h2>
        <p>At whitewolfindia.com, we ONLY stock authentic products. All our items are genuine and are sourced directly from the manufacturer or from their authorized distributors.

        <h2>Returns Policy</h2>
        <p>Kushmanda Cosmetics offers its customers an 'Easy return policy,' wherein you can raise a return/exchange request of a product within 7 days of its delivery. We also accept partial returns wherein you can raise a return request for one or all products in your order.</p>
        
        <h4>Step 1: Contact our Customer Support team</h4>
        <p>Contact our Customer Support team via email (<a href="mailto:care@whitewolfindia.com">care@whitewolfindia.com</a>) within 7 business days of receiving the order. You can also visit your order page to initiate returns.</p>
        
        <h4>Step 2: Provide order ID details</h4>
        <p>Provide us with your order ID details and your request to return/replace/refund your order. Kindly email an image & video of the product and the invoice for our reference.</p>
        
        <h4>Step 3: Product pickup</h4>
        <p>We will pick up the products within 2-4 business days. We will initiate the refund or replacement process only if the products are received by us in their original packaging with their seals, labels, and barcodes intact.</p>
        
        <p>Special instructions for reverse pickup: The reverse product will be assigned within 24-48 hours, and the product will be picked in another 4-5 working days. After the product is picked along with the packaging box, we will initiate a refund after carefully examining it.</p>
        
        <p>Note: If it is a case of replacement, it is subject to the availability of stock. In case that a replacement may not be available, we will refund you the full amount. The free gift is included as a part of the item order and needs to be returned along with the originally delivered product.</p>
        
        <p>In case of one or more defective products in your order, please register a single complaint as the return/replacement will be arranged only once. A return can be created at the item level, and if you have ordered multiple items, you can initiate a return/replacement/refund for any individual item. However, any product being returned needs to be returned in full including all components as well as any complimentary gifts or products which came along with it.</p>

        <p>In case of cash on delivery orders, we will initiate a bank transfer against the refund amount against the billing details shared by you or via UPI transfer. This process will be completed within 24-48 business hours of us receiving the products back and your bank details on email. It will take an additional 2-3 business days for the amount to reflect in your account.</p>
