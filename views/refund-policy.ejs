        <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

        <p>At WhiteWolf India, a brand by Kushmanda Cosmetics Pvt. Ltd., we want you to be completely satisfied with your purchase. Our refund policy outlines the terms and conditions for refunds.</p>

        <h2>Eligibility for Refund:</h2>
        <p>We offer refunds on products that are returned within 7 days of purchase. To be eligible, the product must be unused, in its original packaging, and with the seal intact.</p>

        <h2>Refund Process:</h2>
        <p>To initiate a refund, please contact our customer care team at <a href="mailto:refund@whitewolf.com">refund@whitewolf.com</a> with your order details. Once your return is received and inspected, we will process the refund within 7 working days to your original payment method, reflecting the amount back only if the return is applicable.</p>

        <h2>Non-Refundable Items:</h2>
        <p>Certain items, such as opened or used products, are not eligible for a refund. We do not refund shipping charges unless the return is due to a product defect or an error on our part.</p>

        <h2>Exchanges:</h2>
        <p>If you receive a damaged or defective product, we will happily exchange it for the same item. Please contact our customer care team for assistance.</p>
